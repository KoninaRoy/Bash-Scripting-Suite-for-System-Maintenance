System Maintenance Suite:

The System Maintenance Suite is a Windows-based batch automation project that simplifies system maintenance through scripting.  
It performs tasks like data backup, cleanup of temporary files, log monitoring, and system optimization — all through a single automated script.

This project demonstrates the power of Windows Command Line (CMD) and PowerShell scripting for real-world system management without any third-party tools.
